/**
 * Ask for a pickup — the customer's one write.
 *
 * Five fields, and no more, because five is everything a customer can honestly
 * answer: where the load is, where it is going, what it is, what it weighs, and
 * when they want it collected. Driver, helper, unit and the agreed time are the
 * office's, and putting them on this form would either ask the customer to
 * guess or let a request arrive already assigned — which would skip the
 * confirmation step it exists to ask for.
 *
 * A sixth question comes first for a firm that signed itself up: **who should
 * carry it**. The hauliers near their store, on a small map, nearest first —
 * and the answer decides which company's books the whole thing lands in, whose
 * tariff quotes it and whose desk confirms it. A customer the office added
 * never sees that card: their work goes to the haulier whose customer they are,
 * and offering a choice the API would refuse is worse than offering none.
 *
 * The two ends are the same field the back office books with: a name to type,
 * and a map to pin it on. Typing stays the fast path — most requests are for a
 * town somebody can name — and the pin is what answers a yard with no address,
 * which the old plain text box could only answer with a sentence for the desk
 * to interpret. It is worth more than the map: the tariff prices a run on the
 * distance between the two pins, so a pinned request is quoted on the run it
 * actually is, and the driver is given the spot rather than the neighbourhood.
 *
 * What comes back is the trip, `pending`, with its reference and its price. Both
 * are shown before the screen is dismissed: the reference is what they quote on
 * the phone, and the price is the difference between a request and a hopeful
 * message.

   * a haulier's office writing an address onto its own record of a firm it
