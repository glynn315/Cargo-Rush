/**
 * Where this company's yard is — the pin customers find it by.
 *
 * The registration form asks for it, which covers every company that signs up
 * from now on. This is for the ones that did not: without a pin a haulier does
 * not appear on the carrier list shippers choose from in the app, and there
 * would be no way at all to get on it.
 *
 * It sits beside the company's mark on Access Control for the same reason that
 * card does — this is already the administrator's screen, and `company.manage`
 * is already the permission gating it.
 *
 * **The pin is not the address.** The address is what a letter needs and is
 * edited as text; this is what a distance is measured to and a marker drawn at.
 * Saving moves both, because somebody correcting where they are usually means
 * both — and the address box is filled from the lookup only when it is empty, so
 * a hand-written "Km 9, Sasa" is never replaced by a geocoder's guess.
