 *
 * It lives on Access Control rather than on a settings page of its own because
 * that is already the administrator's screen, and a page holding one card would
 * be a menu item somebody has to find. `company.manage` is the permission, held
 * by the administrator and the general manager; `access.view` is what opens the
 * page around it, and both of those roles hold that too.
 *
 * **Only the logo is editable here.** The name is not: it is what every person
 * in the company sees in the sidebar and what the code was derived from, so
 * changing it is a support conversation rather than a text field somebody can
 * knock while looking for something else.
