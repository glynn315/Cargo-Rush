/**
 * Payroll — a period's pay, checked, frozen, handed out, and put in the books.
 *
 * ## Written for two readers
 *
 * A payroll screen is read by an office manager who wants to know whether the
 * figures are right, and by an accountant who wants the register for the file.
 * Those are different documents, so the page offers both and defaults to the
 * first:
 *
 * **Simple** is one card per person, and it shows the arithmetic rather than
 * assuming it: earned, less held back, equals take-home. Opening a card
 * explains every line on it in words — what SSS is *for*, why the tax is
 * charged after the three funds — because "why is my pay less than my salary"
 * is the question payroll actually gets asked, and a spreadsheet does not
 * answer it.
 *
 * **Register** is the wide grid: everybody, every column, totals along the
 * foot. It is the sheet that goes in the payroll file and the one that prints.
 *
 * ## The three steps, shown as three steps
 *
 * Build, approve, pay. The page states where a run has got to and what happens
 * next, in plain words, because the consequences are not reversible and are not
 * guessable from a status word: approving means payslips can go out and nothing
 * can be changed again, and paying writes the run into the accounts.
 *
 * Payroll's own three words are used for its own three states. The shared
 * status vocabulary has no word for "approved but not yet paid" — borrowing
 * `assigned` from trips put the word *Assigned* on a pay run, which tells a
 * reader nothing.
 *
 * ## No rates on this page
 *
 * The explanations say what each deduction is and how it behaves — a percentage
 * of the monthly salary, up to a ceiling, split across the month's payslips —
 * and never the percentage itself. Those rates live in `config/cargo.php`
 * because **they change, and they change by circular**. Printing "4.5%" here
 * would make this file the second place that knows the SSS rate, and the one
 * nobody remembers to update.
 *
 * ## What the API decides, not this page
 *
 * Each run arrives with `can_edit`, `can_approve` and `can_pay` on it. The
 * rules are the API's, and two clients deriving them from `status` is two
 * places to get them wrong.
 *
 * ## Why the tax does not follow an edit
 *
 * Typing an allowance changes the gross and the net and deliberately leaves the
 * withholding tax alone. An allowance is usually a one-off that the BIR's table
 * would tax as if it were the person's regular pay, and an office correcting
 * one payslip has not asked for the tax to move under them. A run that needs
 * the tax redone is rebuilt — which is the button beside it, and the page says
 * so where somebody is typing.
 *
 * ## Who is on a run
 *
 * Active employees with a monthly basic on record. A fleet's drivers are often
 * paid **per trip**, and that money is already in the daily truck sheet's
 * driver and helper columns — so somebody with no basic is left off rather than
 * paid twice. Anything they are owed goes on as an adjustment.
