/**
 * General Journal — where a transaction is written before it is anything else.
 *
 * The book the rest of Finance rolls up from. Every entry is a date, an
 * accounting category, a narration, and its two sides; the general ledger is
 * this same set of postings sorted by account, and the trial balance is those
 * two columns added up.
 *
 * ## Why this page has a form of its own
 *
 * An entry is not a flat record. It is a head and a variable set of lines, with
 * a rule connecting them — the debits and the credits must agree — and a footer
 * that has to say so *while somebody types*, because the difference is the
 * number that finds a transposed figure. The shared record form renders flat
 * records and would have to grow a special case for this one; the daily ledger
 * sheet took the same decision for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Draft, posted, void
 *
 * A **draft** is work in progress: editable, deletable, and counting towards
 * nothing. **Posting** puts it in the books, and from then on it cannot be
 * changed — that is the whole difference between a journal and a notepad.
 * **Voiding** is how the books take something back: the entry and its lines
 * stay exactly where they are, stop counting, and carry the reason somebody
 * gave.
 *
 * The page does not work any of that out from `status`. Each row arrives with
 * `can_edit`, `can_post` and `can_void` on it, because the rules belong to the
 * API and a button that only ever returns a 422 is worse than no button.
