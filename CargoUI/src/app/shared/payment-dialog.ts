/**
 * Recording money that has arrived — and the only way an invoice becomes paid.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * It did not, and that was a hole with a bad shape. `paid` is derived from the
 * payments against a document, so the office was left marking invoices paid
 * with a status dropdown — which wrote the word and no money, and told one
 * customer ₱21,482 had been collected when the bank had seen none of it. The
 * status option is gone now; this is what replaces it, and it leaves a payment
 * behind: an amount, a date, a method and a reference that can be matched
 * against a bank statement.
 *
 * ## One dialog, two ways in
 *
 * From an invoice — the balance is what is owed on it, filled in and editable.
 * From the Billing page — pick the document the money is against. The same form
 * either way, because "settle this" and "money came in" end in the same record,
 * and two forms would be two chances for one of them to write a payment the
 * other cannot read.
 *
 * The amount defaults to the **balance**, not the invoice total: what a payer
 * owes is the total less any withholding tax and less anything already
 * received, and defaulting to the document's face value is how an invoice ends
 * up over-settled.
