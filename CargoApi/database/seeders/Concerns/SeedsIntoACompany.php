/**
 * Gives a seeder that writes business data a company to write it into.
 *
 * The demo seeders build a worked example — trucks, drivers, trips, a ledger.
 * Every one of those rows belongs to somebody now, and a seeder run from the
 * command line has no signed-in account to belong to. Without this they stop on
 * the first insert, which is the model layer refusing to create an unowned row
 * rather than a bug.
 *
 * `DEMO_COMPANY` names which one, by id, code or name. Left unset it is the
 * oldest company on the install, which on a single-company install is the only
 * one and means nobody has to think about it.
 *
 * Each demo seeder wraps its own `run()` rather than relying on `DemoSeeder` to
 * do it for all four, so any of them still works on its own:
 *
 *     php artisan db:seed --class="Database\Seeders\Demo\FleetSeeder"
 *
 * Nesting is free — `Tenant::use()` restores what it found — so a `DemoSeeder`
 * that has already entered the company loses nothing by each child entering it
 * again.
