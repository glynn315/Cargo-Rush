/**
 * The roles an install starts with, and what each one reaches.
 *
 * The five from `Shared\Enums\Role` are seeded with exactly the permissions
 * that enum already granted, so an install that runs this changes nothing about
 * who can do what. Three more are added because every fleet asks for them and
 * none of them justified a code change:
 *
 *   General Manager — the whole business, except the access screens. That is
 *   the one distinction between them and the administrator, and it is a real
 *   one: the GM runs the company, the administrator hands out keys.
 *
 *   Treasury — money moving in and out. Bills, collects, files spend. Cannot
 *   redraw the rate card, which is the accountant's.
 *
 *   HR Officer — the roster and the hiring, and `drivers.view` so a new hire
 *   can be linked to the operational record. Deliberately no `access.manage`:
 *   whoever runs HR should not be able to grant themselves the ledger.
 *
 * Permissions are synced on every run because they are this file's definition
 * of the role. What is *not* touched is a role the office added itself, or
 * anything about who holds which role.
