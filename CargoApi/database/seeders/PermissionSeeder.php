/**
 * The permission vocabulary.
 *
 * Developer-owned, unlike roles and positions: a permission is only real if
 * code checks for it, so one invented in the UI would gate nothing. Adding a
 * permission means adding it here *and* naming it on the route that should
 * require it — a row on its own does nothing.
 *
 * `updateOrCreate`, not `firstOrCreate`, and the difference matters on the
 * second run: these rows are this file's, so a wording fix in a later release
 * reaches installs that already exist. What is *not* touched is which roles
 * hold them — that is the office's, and it lives in the pivot.
