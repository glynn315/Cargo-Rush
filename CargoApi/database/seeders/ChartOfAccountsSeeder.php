/**
 * The chart of accounts a haulier can start posting to on day one.
 *
 * Configuration, not data — the same kind of thing as the roles and the expense
 * categories beside it. A company with no chart of accounts cannot write a
 * single journal entry, so an empty `accounts` table is not a business waiting
 * to enter its first record; it is a module that cannot be opened.
 *
 * ## Why this chart, and not a generic one
 *
 * Every account here is one a Philippine trucking firm actually keeps. The
 * numbering is the conventional one — 1000s assets, 2000s liabilities, 3000s
 * equity, 4000s income, 5000s expenses — because an accountant, an auditor and
 * a BIR examiner all expect to find cash in the 1000s, and a clever scheme of
 * our own would cost every one of them time.
 *
 * The expense block is where a fleet's chart earns its keep, and it deliberately
 * mirrors the workbook this system grew out of: diesel, driver salary, helper
 * salary, allowance and maintenance are the five columns of the daily truck
 * sheet, and each has an account of its own here. That is what will let a day's
 * sheet post itself into the journal later without anybody deciding, per row,
 * where it goes.
 *
 * `is_system` on all of them. An office may rename any account, retire any it
 * does not use, and add as many of its own as it likes — but it cannot delete
 * one of these, because code will eventually post to them by code number and an
 * install missing 5010 would fail somewhere far away from whoever tidied it up.
 *
 * ## Idempotent, and safe after a rename
 *
 * Matched on `code`, and only the columns that define the account are written.
 * A firm that renames 5010 from "Fuel and diesel" to "Diesel" keeps that
 * through every future deployment: the seeder does not touch `name`, `group`,
 * `position` or `status` on an account that already exists. Which means adding
 * an account in a later release tops up every company (see `CompanyProvisioner`)
 * without undoing a single thing an office has done to its own chart.
