    | Diesel — how pump price moves a quote
    |----------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | A rate card is drawn at some assumed fuel price. When the pump moves, the
    | whole card is wrong by roughly the fuel share of the run, and the choice
    | is between retyping every bracket or deriving the difference. This is the
    | second one:
    |
    |     move       = (today - baseline) / baseline
    |     adjustment = clamp(move * sensitivity, -cap, +cap)
    |     price      = bracket price * (1 + adjustment)
    |
    | `baseline_cents` is the pump price the brackets were priced at. A zone may
    | override it; most installs buy fuel at one price and never will.
    |
    | `sensitivity` is the fuel share of a run — how much of the price actually
    | is diesel. At 0.35, a 10% pump rise moves the quote 3.5%, not 10%. Passing
    | the whole move through would overcharge, because salary, tyres and the
    | office did not get more expensive.
    |
    | `cap_bp` is the guard rail, in basis points. Whatever the pump does, a
    | quote does not move more than this from the card without somebody
    | deciding to redraw it — a bad `baseline_cents` should produce a visibly
    | capped figure, not a bill nobody can explain.
