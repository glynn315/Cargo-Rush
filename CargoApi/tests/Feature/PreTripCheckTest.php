/**
 * The pre-trip check, and the departure it stands in front of.
 *
 * DESIGN.md section 5.2 has had the checklist on the handset from the start —
 * tyres, oil, gears, brakes, lights, coolant, documents — and it had no
 * consequence: a driver could skip it and leave, which made it a form rather
 * than a check. These tests are about the consequence.
 *
 * Three properties, and they are the whole feature:
 *
 *   **No pass, no departure.** Enforced in `TripService`, so it holds for
 *   whatever calls it rather than for one endpoint.
 *
 *   **The check belongs to the run.** A pass on one trip does not clear
 *   another, because a pre-trip check is a check before *a trip* — the tyres
 *   somebody looked at this morning are not the tyres they are about to leave
 *   on this afternoon.
 *
 *   **The customer can see the truck was checked**, without being shown the
 *   haulier's maintenance faults on a load that has not moved.
