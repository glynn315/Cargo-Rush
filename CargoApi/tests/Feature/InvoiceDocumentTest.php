/**
 * The invoice as a document — the thing that leaves the building.
 *
 * A screen can leave a lot implicit. A document cannot: it is what a client's
 * accounts department files, what a collector carries, and what somebody reads
 * back in two years to settle an argument. So these tests are about the things
 * a printed invoice has to say and a list row does not — who is billing, both
 * TINs, what the haul was, what has been paid against it, and the amount in
 * words.
 *
 * Plus the export beside it, which is the same list somebody is looking at,
 * unpaginated, with all five tax figures on it. An export missing the
 * withholding cannot be reconciled against a bank statement, which is the only
 * reason anybody exports this.
