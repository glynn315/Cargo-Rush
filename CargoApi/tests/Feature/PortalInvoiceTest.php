/**
 * What a customer is shown about the money, and how they can check it.
 *
 * The office reads an invoice as a row it can cross-check against a ledger. A
 * customer reads one figure on a phone and has nothing to check it against —
 * which is how a wrong total went unquestioned for a month, and how a right one
 * gets queried. So the portal sends the **liquidation**: the haul, the net, the
 * VAT, anything withheld, every payment received, and what is left.
 *
 * Two other decisions are pinned here. The list is ordered by the day the
 * customer *asked* for the pickup rather than the day the office raised the
 * paperwork, because that is the date they know it by. And a delivered run is
 * finished business — the API still returns it, and the app shows it only under
 * History.
