/**
 * What a driver actually has at the door.
 *
 * The hand-off used to require a `pod_ref` — a reference number the driver had
 * no source for, and therefore invented in the cab. It looked like evidence and
 * was not: two runs could carry the same one, and a delivery could be closed
 * against a reference that named nothing.
 *
 * The reference is now the system's, assigned like a trip's `CR-` number. What
 * the driver is asked for is the photograph and the name of whoever took the
 * load — which is what they can actually see.
 *
 * The fake uploads here are built with `create(..., 'image/jpeg')` rather than
 * `image()`: the latter draws a real bitmap and needs the GD extension, which
 * is not a reasonable thing for this suite to require. The validation rules
 * read the mime type, so a declared one exercises them exactly the same way.
