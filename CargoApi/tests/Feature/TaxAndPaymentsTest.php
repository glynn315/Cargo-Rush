 * What an invoice says, and what actually arrives.
 *
 * These were the same number until now, and in Philippine freight they never
 * are. A ₱10,000 haul is billed at ₱11,200 with VAT; a customer who is a
 * withholding agent keeps back ₱224 and remits it to the BIR; ₱10,976 lands in
 * the bank. The system knew only the ₱10,000, so the document it printed was
 * not one a VAT-registered customer could accept and the figure it expected
 * never matched the payment.
 *
 * The second half is money arriving. Settling used to be a status flip, which
 * models being paid in full, once, from nowhere in particular — and customers
 * pay in instalments, and settle four invoices with one cheque.
