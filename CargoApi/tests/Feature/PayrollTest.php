/**
 * Payroll: a fortnight's pay, frozen, handed out, and put in the books.
 *
 * What these tests are actually defending:
 *
 *   **The figures are worked out, not typed.** A run is built from the employee
 *   records, and every statutory deduction on it comes from the rate table in
 *   `config/cargo.php`. The arithmetic is asserted to the centavo here because
 *   a payslip is a promise to a person and to the government both.
 *
 *   **The BIR's order.** Tax is charged on gross *less* the three
 *   contributions. Getting that backwards overstates the tax on every payslip,
 *   which is why the order has a test of its own and not just the total.
 *
 *   **Approving freezes it.** Payslips go out at approval, so nothing may move
 *   afterwards — not a line, not a rebuild, not a delete.
 *
 *   **Paying posts it.** A paid run writes the journal entry an accountant
 *   would write by hand, the trial balance still balances afterwards, and the
 *   same run can never post twice.
