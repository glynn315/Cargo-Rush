/**
 * Trip Monitoring is one row per truck per day (DESIGN.md section 5.1), and it
 * used to hear about a day only if somebody recorded one — so a trip could be
 * delivered and the sheet stay empty. Delivering now opens the row.
 *
 * It also **fills in the income**, which it did not before. The rule that
 * income is entered rather than derived came from the transcribed workbook,
 * where a row is a record of a day already priced and already agreed. It could
 * not survive a customer booking their own delivery: there is nobody to type a
 * figure at that point, and a haul whose price nobody recorded earned the
 * business nothing on its own books. So the trip is quoted from the tariff when
 * it is booked, and the delivery credits that figure here.
 *
 * The expenses stay entered. A trip knows what it was charged; it has no idea
 * what the fuel cost.
