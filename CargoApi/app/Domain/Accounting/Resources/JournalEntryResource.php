 * read — the whole content of a journal entry is which accounts moved and by
 * how much — so there is no "summary" shape of this resource and no second call
 * to fetch the detail.
 *
 * The totals are computed from the lines rather than stored (see
 * `JournalEntry`), which is why they are here on every read: the client should
 * not add up a list to find out whether the entry it is showing balances.
