/**
 * A journal entry and its sides, on their way in.
 *
 * The one DTO in the system that carries a collection of other DTOs, and it has
 * to: an entry and its lines are one act. Writing the head and then the lines
 * in two calls would allow a moment where an entry exists with no sides — a row
 * that is not a transaction — and a failure between the two would leave it there
 * for good.
 *
 * The arithmetic is here rather than in the service because it is a property of
 * the payload, not of the writing: `isBalanced()` is what the request validator
 * asks so the caller gets a 422 naming the difference, and what the service
 * asks again before it posts. Two checks of one rule, on purpose — the second
 * is what makes it true for a console command or an automatic posting that
 * never went near a form.
