/**
 * The general journal — writing transactions into the books.
 *
 * Everything that changes a journal entry goes through here, and there are
 * only four things you can do to one: write it, edit it while it is still a
 * draft, post it, and void it once posted. That list is short on purpose. A
 * ledger's value is that it is not a spreadsheet, and every extra verb is
 * another way for the history to stop matching what happened.
 *
 * ## The three rules this class exists to hold
 *
 * **An entry balances or it is not written.** Checked again here even though
 * `JournalEntryRequest` checks it first, because a validator only protects the
 * one door it stands at: a console command, a seeder or a future automatic
 * posting from an invoice reaches this method and not that form. The exception
 * it throws is deliberately not a validation error — by the time code is
 * calling this, an unbalanced entry is a bug, not a typo.
 *
 * **A posted entry is immutable.** No update, no delete, no re-post. This is
 * the whole difference between a journal and a notepad, and it is enforced on
 * the model (`isLocked()`) so it holds no matter which way in somebody comes.
 *
 * **Withdrawing is voiding, not deleting.** A void keeps the row, keeps its
 * lines, records who did it and why, and stops counting towards every balance.
 * Deleting it would remove the evidence that the office ever made the mistake,
 * which is exactly the thing an auditor is looking for.
 *
 * ## Lines are replaced, never merged
 *
 * Editing a draft replaces its lines wholesale. Merging would mean deciding
 * what a payload missing one line meant — deleted, or unchanged? — and the two
 * answers differ by a whole side of a transaction. Replacing has one meaning,
 * and the request requires the full set for the same reason.
