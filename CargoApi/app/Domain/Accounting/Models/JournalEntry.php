/**
 * One transaction in the general journal.
 *
 * A date, a reference, a category, a memo — and its sides on `journal_lines`.
 * There is no amount column, because a transaction does not have *an* amount:
 * it has debits and credits, they are equal, and the pair of them is what the
 * journal shows. `totalDebits()` reads the lines rather than a stored figure,
 * so an entry can never claim a total its own sides do not add up to.
 *
 * ## The three states, and why two of them are one-way
 *
 * `draft` is somebody's work in progress. Editable, deletable, and invisible to
 * every balance — an entry nobody has posted has not happened.
 *
 * `posted` is in the books. Not editable and not deletable, and that is not a
 * missing feature: a ledger that can be quietly rewritten afterwards is not a
 * record of anything. The check is here, in `isLocked()`, rather than in the
 * controller, so it holds for a console command and a future automatic posting
 * as well as for a form.
 *
 * `void` is a posted entry taken back. The row and its lines stay exactly as
 * they were and stop counting, so the history reads honestly: somebody posted
 * this, and then somebody withdrew it, and here is the reason they gave. A
 * deleted row would have made the same correction invisible.
