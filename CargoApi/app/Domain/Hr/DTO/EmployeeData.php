/**
 * The photograph is deliberately not here.
 *
 * It arrives as an uploaded file, not as a column value, and the path it turns
 * into is decided by `PhotoStore` after the file is written. Carrying it
 * through the DTO would mean either a `UploadedFile` in something whose whole
 * job is to be a flat set of column values, or a path invented before the file
 * exists.
 *
 * **Neither is `driver_id`, and that one is a change.** It used to be here,
 * filled from a dropdown of every driver on file. It is now decided by
 * `EmployeeService` from the licence number instead — see `LicenceData` — so
 * the client no longer sends it and nothing here should carry it. Leaving the
 * field would mean a payload naming somebody else's driver record was still
 * obeyed, which is the whole thing the change removes.
