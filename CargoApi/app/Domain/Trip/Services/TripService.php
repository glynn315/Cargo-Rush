/**
 * Booking, confirming, amending and closing a trip.
 *
 * A trip is not just a row: dispatch and delivery records exist for its whole
 * life so the Dispatch and Delivery Logs modules never show a gap for a trip
 * that plainly exists. Creating those alongside it is this service's job.
 *
 * ## The states, and who owns each
 *
 * | Status       | Means                                | Who writes it |
 * | ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------- |
 * | `pending`    | Requested. Nobody is on it yet.      | Customer, or the office |
 * | `scheduled`  | Booked for a later day, crew named.  | Office |
 * | `assigned`   | Confirmed and actionable now.        | Office (`confirm`), or the clock |
 * | `in_transit` | On the road.                         | Driver (`start`) |
 * | `delivered`  | Handed over, with the proof.         | Driver (`deliver`) |
 *
 * `pending` used to mean "due and waiting for the driver", which left nothing
 * to call a request nobody had looked at yet. It now means exactly that — work
 * asking for a decision — and `assigned` carries what it used to: a run with a
 * driver, a helper, a unit and a time, which is the only state a driver can
 * leave on. That is the whole reason confirming is a step: a customer's
 * request has none of those four, so there is nothing for a driver to act on
 * until somebody at the desk supplies them.
