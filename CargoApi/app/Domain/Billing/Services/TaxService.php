/**
 * What tax an invoice carries, worked out once.
 *
 * Three parties each hold part of the answer, and none of them holds all of
 * it — which is why this is a service rather than a method on the invoice:
 *
 *   **The statute** sets the rates. `config('cargo.tax')`, so a rate change
 *   is a deployment setting rather than a code change.
 *
 *   **The company** decides whether it charges VAT at all. Below the
 *   registration threshold a haulier files percentage tax instead and issues
 *   invoices with no VAT line — putting one on would be charging a tax it has
 *   no authority to collect.
 *
 *   **The customer** decides the rest: whether they are vatable, zero-rated or
 *   exempt, and whether they withhold. Both are properties of who is being
 *   billed, not of what was hauled.
 *
 * The result is **frozen onto the invoice**, rates included. An invoice is a
 * promise made on a date, exactly as a trip's price is, and the reasons are
 * the same: rates change by statute, a company registers for VAT, a customer
 * becomes a withholding agent — and none of that may quietly alter a document
 * somebody is holding a copy of.
