/**

 * The two halves are separate on purpose. A payment is an event — a cheque
 * cleared on the 14th, reference 88213 — and where it was applied is a
 * decision that may span four invoices or half of one. Modelling it as a
 * status on the invoice, which is what this replaces, could express neither.
 *
 * **Invoice statuses are written from here and nowhere else.** `paid`,
 * `partial` and the `paid_at` stamp are all derived from the allocations, and
 * this is the only thing that recomputes them. That is the same arrangement
 * the overdue sweep uses: the fact lives in the data, and something walks it
 * to keep the stored copy honest so lists can filter and index on it.
