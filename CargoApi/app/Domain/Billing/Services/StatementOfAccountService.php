/**
 * A statement of account: what one firm owed, what moved, and what is left.
 *
 * The document a collections call is made from, and the one a customer's
 * accounts department asks for when the invoices and their own records have
 * stopped agreeing. It is not a list of invoices — the billing page is already
 * that. It is a **running account**: an opening balance, every document and
 * every payment in date order, and a closing balance that follows from them.
 *
 * ## Why the running balance matters
 *
 * An aging report says ₱48,000 is 30 days late. A statement says *how it got
 * there*: this invoice, that part payment, this credit. When a customer
 * disputes a figure, the disagreement is always about one line — and a
 * statement is the only view that puts both sides' lines in the same order so
 * the argument can be about a fact rather than a total.
 *
 * ## Both directions
 *
 * The same report serves a **customer** (what they owe us) and a **supplier**
 * (what we owe them), because a statement of account is symmetrical: one
 * party's receivable is the other's payable. `direction` decides which set of
 * documents is read, and the words on the page follow from it — a supplier
 * statement that said "amount due from" would be read the wrong way round by
 * whoever is paying it.
 *
 * ## Opening balance
 *
 * Everything before the range, netted: documents raised less money received.
 * Without it a statement for March would open at zero and close short by
 * whatever February left owing, which is the error that makes a statement worth
 * less than the invoices it was built from.
