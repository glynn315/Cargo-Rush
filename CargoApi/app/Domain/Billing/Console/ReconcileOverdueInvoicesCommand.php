 * The exact counterpart of `cargo:trips-overdue`, and it had the same gap:
 * `BillingService::reconcileOverdue()` was written to be run on a schedule and
 * nothing ran it, so the manual's promise that "anything still pending past its
 * due date becomes Overdue on its own" was only true if somebody edited the
 * row. This is the caller that makes it true — and the Dashboard's overdue
 * figure depends on it, because a receivable that is late in fact and `pending`
 * in the table is money nobody is chasing.
