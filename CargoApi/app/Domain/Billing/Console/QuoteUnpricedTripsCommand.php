/**
 * Price trips that were booked before there was a tariff.
 *
 * Every trip entered before the tariff existed carries a price of zero, which
 * is not "free" — it is "nobody asked". Left alone, those runs would show ₱0 on
 * the board, credit nothing to the monitoring sheet when delivered, and raise
 * no invoice. Exactly the shape of the gap `cargo:ledger-backfill` was written
 * for: the link only working forward reads as a bug rather than as a cutover.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative about what it touches:
 *
 *  - **Only a zero price.** Anything already priced was either quoted or
 *    negotiated, and both are somebody's decision.
 *  - **Only an unbilled trip.** A delivered run that has already put its
 *    figure on the sheet and raised its invoice is settled history; repricing
 *    it would leave the trip disagreeing with the document the customer holds.
 *
 * Which also makes it idempotent: a second run finds nothing left to do.
 *
 * A trip with no distance is quoted on the base fare and the weight alone,
 * which is less than the haul is worth. `--dry-run` lists them so the office
 * can pin those on a map first and get a real figure.
