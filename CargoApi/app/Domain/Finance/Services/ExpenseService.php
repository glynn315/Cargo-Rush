/**
 * Categorised spend — the "what did it go on" half of Finance.

 * Two things here are not plain CRUD, and both are about keeping this module
 * honest against the ledger it feeds:
 *
 *   - An expense filed against a truck on a date attaches itself to that
 *     truck's sheet for the day, creating the row if the day has none. The
 *     alternative is spend that exists in one report and not the other.
 *   - A category with rows against it is retired, never deleted, because
 *     deleting it would take the spend with it and a closed quarter would
 *     quietly stop balancing.
