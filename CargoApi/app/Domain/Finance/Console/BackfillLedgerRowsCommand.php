 * started opening it themselves.
 *
 * Without this, the link only works forward: a business that has been running
 * trips would see an empty Trip Monitoring until its next delivery, which
 * reads exactly like the bug the link was added to fix.
 *
 * Idempotent, because it goes through the same `openDailyRow` the delivery
 * does — a day already on the sheet is found rather than opened again, and no
 * figure anybody has entered is touched.
