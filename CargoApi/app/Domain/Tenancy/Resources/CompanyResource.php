 * The company, as both clients see it.
 *
 * Only what a shell needs to say whose system this is: the name for the header,
 * the mark beside it, and the code for the rare occasion somebody has to quote
 * it to support. The status stays server-side — it has already been acted on by
 * the time a client could read it, because a suspended company cannot sign in.
 *
 * The contact details ride along only on the company's own endpoints, where the
 * caller holds `company.manage`. They are not in `MeResource`, which every
 * signed-in account reads: a driver's handset has no use for the billing
 * contact, and shipping it to one is a detail leaked for no reason.
