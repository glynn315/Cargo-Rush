/**
 * What the government takes out of a payslip.
 *
 * SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG and withholding tax, worked out from the rates in
 * `config/cargo.php` — where they live precisely because **they change, and
 * they change by circular rather than by law.** All four have moved in the last
 * few years. A payroll module with the rates in code is wrong within a year and
 * needs a deployment to fix.
 *
 * ## What this is honest about
 *
 * The real SSS schedule is a bracketed table of monthly salary credits, not a
 * percentage. This is the percentage-with-a-ceiling approximation that every
 * small office starts with: close in the middle of the range, wrong at the ends.
 * The same is true, less severely, of PhilHealth's floor and ceiling. Every
 * figure it produces is editable on the pay run line, which is the escape hatch
 * that makes an approximation usable — an office that knows the right number
 * types the right number.
 *
 * Withholding tax is the one that is *not* approximated: it is the BIR's own
 * graduated table, applied to taxable pay in the order the BIR applies it —
 * gross **less the three contributions**, because taxing before them overstates
 * the tax on every payslip.
 *
 * ## Monthly rates on a semi-monthly payslip
 *
 * The contributions are monthly figures. A fleet paying twice a month splits
 * each in half, which is what offices do and what `runs_per_month` says. The
 * withholding table is the semi-monthly one, so it is applied to the period's
 * own taxable pay rather than halved — that is the difference between a
 * contribution and a tax bracket, and treating them alike is the usual mistake.
