/**
 * The customer's own screens — what `cargoApp` shows when the account signing
 * in is a customer rather than a driver.
 *
 * The exact counterpart of `DriverTripController`, and separate from
 * `TripController` for the same reason: every endpoint here is scoped to the
 * accounts behind the caller's login and carries no id that could be changed
 * into somebody else's. The office reads the same trips through the module
 * controller, with the permissions that come with it.
 *
 * A **self-registered** shipper may deal with several hauliers — they choose one
 * from `GET portal/carriers` when they file a request — so the reads here total
 * across those carriers and each row says which carrier it belongs to. The
 * scoping itself is unchanged and is not weakened by it: `PortalService` reads
 * one carrier's books at a time, inside that carrier's tenancy.
 *
 * A customer the **office created** never has more than one, and is shown no
 * other: the list and a named carrier are both refused for them, which is why
 * their portal behaves exactly as it did before any of this existed.
