/**
 * The customer's own view of their work and their money.
 *
 * The same arrangement the driver endpoints use, for the same reason: every
 * read here is scoped to a record resolved from the token, so there is no id in
 * a path for somebody to change into another firm's. A customer asking for "my
 * deliveries" is asking a different question from the office asking for "all
 * deliveries", and answering it through the module controller with a filter
 * would mean one forgotten `where` exposes the whole board.
 *
 * It owns no table. It composes the trip and invoice repositories and delegates
 * writing to `TripService`, so a request booked here goes through exactly the
 * same path — reference, delivery log, tariff quote, notification — as one the
 * office enters.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of customer, and one of them may choose
 *
 * A customer the **office added** is that haulier's. Their deliveries, their
 * invoices and every request they file are that company's, and they are shown
 * no other carrier at all — `mustBeAbleToChoose()` refuses both the list and a
 * `carrier_id` in a payload. The relationship is what the fleet is paying for.
 *
 * A customer who **signed themselves up** arrived at the platform rather than at
 * a company. They see the hauliers near the load (`carriers()`) and file with
 * whichever they pick; that carrier gets an ordinary `customers` row and an
 * ordinary pending trip in its own books, and may not be the same one next week.
 * See `ShipperAccounts` and `ShipperRegistrationService`.
 *
 * Registering asks for none of that, so such an account starts with **no
 * carriers at all** — and that is a state to answer rather than an error to
 * report. The reads total across nothing and come back empty, `carriers()` is
 * the one thing they have to do, and a request that names a haulier opens the
 * first account. A request that names none is the one refusal: there is no
 * usual carrier to fall back on yet, and picking one for somebody is the single
 * thing this feature exists not to do.
 *
 * Which means every read here spans companies — and **none of them lifts the
 * tenant scope to do it**. The accounts are resolved first, then each carrier's
 * books are read inside that carrier's own tenancy and the answers are added up
 * here. A handful of small scoped queries beats one wide unscoped one: the
 * property that keeps two hauliers apart is never suspended, not even briefly,
 * and a bug in this file can at worst mis-total a customer's own figures.
 *
 * A customer with one carrier — every customer of a single-tenant install, and
 * every customer the office created — takes exactly the path they always did,
 * because the loop runs once.
