/**
 * A customer asking for a load to be picked up.
 *
 * Deliberately the smallest form in the system. Everything the office decides
 * is missing — driver, helper, unit, schedule, status — not because a customer
 * could not be shown those fields, but because they have no basis to fill them
 * in and a request that arrived pre-assigned would bypass the confirmation it
 * exists to ask for. `POST trips/{trip}/confirm` is where those four arrive.
 *
 * `customer_id` and `requested_by` are absent for a stronger reason: they are
 * the scope. Accepting either from the client would let one customer file a
 * request against another's account, which is the same hole the driver
 * endpoints avoid by taking no trip id. The controller stamps both from the
 * token.
 *
 * `preferred_at` is the customer's *wish*, mapped onto `scheduled_at`. The
 * desk can move it when confirming, which is the honest arrangement: a
 * customer asks for Tuesday morning, the fleet says whether Tuesday morning
 * is possible.
